# StarDrawing
A repository for storing open source project

/***********************Star🖌Drawing*********************/

  This is an open Android project😃. The main function of this application is to integrate painting and social integration, which can easily bring users to draw, quickly draw, and share typesetting.
  At present, the development progress is only about one tenth. It took me more than one week to make the basic Activity view and the art design on it, and it took me about two weeks to deploy them in my software.
  This is my first time to integrate and develop software. I am basically responsible for all the art design and code writing in it. In the near future, I also hope that someone can give me suggestions.
  
这是一个公开的安卓项目😃，该应用的主要功能是集成绘画与社交一体，便捷的为用户带来画板排版，快速绘画，分享排版。
目前的开发进度大概只有十分之一左右，我用时一周多将基本的Activity视图和在这之上的美术设计做了出来，由用了大概两周将他们部署在了我的软件里面。
这是我第一次集成开发软件，里面的所有美术设计以及代码编写基本都由我一人完成。在不久之后我也希望有人能够给我提出意见。但是我更希望该项目能由我一个人完成。
